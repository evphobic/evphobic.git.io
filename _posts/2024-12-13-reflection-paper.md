My investigation was based on the thesis of my 
digital project, which reads, 
"This project seeks to investigate how secular frameworks may unintentionally reinforce gender bias and religious discrimination in modern Canada while promoting a transformative approach within public institutions to advance gender equality and dismantle misogynistic structures." By exposing the complexity of secularism, particularly the idea that it is an ontological framework rather than merely an ideology, this endeavour helped me to better grasp it. This change in viewpoint improved my understanding of how secularism functions in governmental organizations and engages with gender and religious concerns. 

I also learnt more about the workings of Canadian law and how it is changing to combat gender discrimination thanks to this project. Although I had originally intended to concentrate my research on Manitoba, challenges like restricted access to provincial reports led me to broaden my emphasis to encompass the entirety of Canada. This change improved the depth of my analysis by enabling me to interact with a wider variety of sources and viewpoints. My efforts to include Nahanni Fontaine, the Minister of Women and Gender Equality, in a podcast interview was another crucial component of my project. This concept, however, was not possible due to time constraints, so I changed my media format to a blog post. This change not only showed the value of adaptability in research but also gave me the chance to enhance my written discourse communication abilities. I was inspired to work on this project by Joan Scott's work on gender and secularism, which we discussed in class. As a woman of colour who identifies as religious, her thoughts struck a deep chord with me and provided a personal link to my studies. 

All things considered, this project has been a wonderful educational opportunity that has promoted critical thinking and a sophisticated comprehension of the relationship between institutional frameworks, gender, and secularism.
