**Info Notice:** Read the blog post [Secularism: A history lesson](#). To learn more about what secularism is and the concepts it's built off of for background knowledge about this post. {: .notice--info}


How much religion is too much? If someone asked you right now to pick between being treated equally but having to give up your religion or being who you are knowing you won’t be treated equally for it what would you choose? Think about it. It’s a hypothetical question though so it doesn’t have to be taken seriously…right? But what if it wasn’t. That’s the reality of what it’s like for a lot of religious identifying women of colour in society. Being faced with choices such as picking between being faithful in your religion or treated fairly as a woman in your own workplace. As a minority within a minority the perspective of feeling isolated in a place you’d call your home is an unfortunate situation a lot of Canadian women are faced with. Especially when that treatment is portrayed through the actions of your own government. Within the constant progression towards secularism and fair treatment, the hyperfocus of one goal has now become a tunnel vision journey blind to the consequences. But how do we call these actions out? Where do we begin to define such terms? Well luckily for you guys I’ve done the research, I looked up the terms and have calculated all the numbers (there were little to no numbers involved). So have no fear, I’m here to tell you what’s going on, who’s involved, and what we (the government) could do. To say it in a more professional tone, this blog post seeks to investigate how secular frameworks may reinforce gender bias and religious discrimination in modern Canada, and introduce a transformative approach for public institutions and legislation to advance gender equality and dismantle misogynistic structures. But to do thst you need to do some basic term learning. Luckily I have another post that helps you with exactly that! So if you haven't already go check it out and then come back and let's discuss!
