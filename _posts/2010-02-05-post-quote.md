The history of secularism and its components greatly stemmed from the Medieval European Christian era. The forefather word, saeculum, was the line that separated two worlds. The first world is the blueprint of a natural reality and the other world, a supernatural and omnipotent land of belief. Many ideas and concepts associated with the creation of secularism were drawn from the experiences and practices of the Christian world. It makes sense gathering that it was the most well-known and common religion at the time. It took several critical thinkers and scholars, and a lot of societal growth to piece together the dynamics of secularism, what the secular is, being secularized, and the different secularities. In the next paragraph, I’ll do my best to explain and use examples of what those terms mean in the simplest and easiest way possible. So think of it as a special edition manual of secularism for dummies.

What is the secular?

Imagine a big balancing beam, on one end there’s what you believe in, your faith, and the spiritual aspects of what formulates you and your identity. All the morals, ethics, and high-grounded thinking you’ve stored that stemmed from that. How you view yourself, the people around you, and life that has developed from your religion, or any for that matter. Now think even bigger than yourself, any historical, social, and political aspect that’s been influenced by or created from any frameworks of any religion. That is the non-secular, or ‘religion’, side of the beam. Now on the other side of that beam is deemed as everything opposite that. The reality, existence, anything man-made and stemming from the mortal conscious, freed from the influence of religious domain, is the secular side. This concept of the balancing beam is a metaphor for the binary system created that intertwined these terms mutually as black-and-white opposites. Though, it is argued that as time progresses and we grow this beam is never truly balanced. What makes up the aspects of these two terms are entirely context-based and never universally agreed upon.

To be secularized? How so?

Now let’s paint another picture, imagine the crucifix, an important object in Christian theology. The meaning tied to it and its significant religious connotation with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. If we wiped clean all of its denotation and attachment to that history, how would it be imagined as now? In the eyes of someone who has no prior knowledge of any of that, it would just be an object with a presumed dead guy just hanging off a cross. When we remove or restrict any religious predispositions we secularize it. Although we can’t just remove the meaning of a crucifix from everyone’s mind past, present, and future alike. Contemporarily, we can begin to introduce mechanisms alike to the public on the many political, social, legal, and institutional levels. An example of this would be the 3 components of secularizing, the privatization of religion, the decline of religiosity, and the differentiation of religion. This could range from banning religious symbols in public domains or the concept of church and state. Understanding these components helps us theorize and predict the understanding of religion and how it’ll develop concerning our society. 

Different secularities? How is that possible?

Secularities refer to the ways of being secular, so now we’re observing it through the eyes of an individual, a group, a family, a nation, or a legal assembly. This in turn points out the idea of secularism being context-specific and does not fall within an abstract secularity. So then it helps us highlight secularism within a Western lens or a third-world lens and how it operates. Even in the instance of politics and how it is used in law-making, we can introduce the nature of secularist use in these domains as statecraft. These practices stemming from the use of these frameworks identify the ideas and potential biases that could potentially be upheld, which is what we set out to analyze through this research.
